          In this game, the player has to go through a challenging escape room where they must navigate through three progressively complex rooms. 
          Each room has unique riddles and puzzles, but solving the puzzles in later rooms requires knowledge of the previous rooms. 
          The goal is to find hidden clues and solve puzzles to escape before water slowly rises into the rooms and ultimately fails.
          <br><br>
          The player would be given a flashlight to see and navigate through the rooms and will have to find keys in each room in order to escape that room. 
          The flashlight might even be helpful in finding clues. 
          In order to find that key to unlock the door, there would be activities to do, ranging from solving a puzzle to interacting with multiple objects. 
          Once the player has found the key, they will be able to escape, but be careful; there might be multiple keys that don't work.
          <br><br>
          There is a timer that will count down.
          Once that timer hits zero, there will be water, which would slowly fill up the room. 
          There still is a chance to escape. 
          However, once the water rises to a certain height, the player would start floating, making it harder to unlock doors and escape. 
          So hurry up, or else it will be difficult to escape. 
          There is a button that will stop the water from rising so that there is a chance to escape.
          <br><br>
          In order to win, the player would need to escape out of all three rooms. 
          In addition, there is going to be a room, out of many, to escape from.
          Be careful; the rooms look like the exit but aren't. 
          The rising water may or may not be helpful.
          <br><br>
          There is a small box on the table in the first room, which will open a pop-up of instructions and controls for help.
